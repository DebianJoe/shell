Tired of asking questions about sed/awk/etc...gonna learn it myself.  Ain't got no teacher...just looking at what each thing does and seeing if I can get it to do the things I want.

Lots of Bash pros out there...probably should leave it to them, but I can't help myself.

Nothing here belongs to me, per se.  Just some hacking that I want to remember.
